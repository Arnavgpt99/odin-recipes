    <h1><strong>Aloo-Tikki</strong></h1>

    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Aloo Tikki is the ultimate street food comfort — golden, crispy potato patties with a soft, spiced center that practically melts in your mouth. Made from mashed boiled potatoes blended with simple spices and lightly pan-fried, these little discs of joy are crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and endlessly versatile. Whether you pair them with tangy tamarind chutney, spicy green chutney, or even stuff them in a bun to make an Indian-style burger, Aloo Tikki delivers big flavor from humble ingredients.</p>
    <p>Beyond its addictive taste, Aloo Tikki is a quick, budget-friendly snack that doesn’t require fancy cooking skills or a long grocery list. Potatoes bring complex carbs for energy, while shallow frying with minimal oil keeps it lighter than deep-fried snacks. Add a sprinkle of fresh coriander, and you’ve got a dish that’s vibrant, comforting, and ready in under 20 minutes. It’s the kind of snack you can whip up anytime — for guests, late-night cravings, or even a cozy rainy-day treat.</p>
