    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Kaju Paneer is a rich and comforting North Indian curry made with tender cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) and buttery cashews in a silky tomato-onion gravy. The cashews are either added whole for a pleasant bite or blended into a paste, giving the sauce its signature creaminess and slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Spices like cumin, garam masala, and mild chili blend with the tang of tomatoes to create a balanced dish that pairs perfectly with naan, roti, or steamed rice. Its smooth texture, mild heat, and luxurious taste make it a favorite for special occasions as well as cozy weekend meals.</p>
    <p>
        Nutritionally, Kaju Paneer offers a good mix of protein from paneer, healthy fats and minerals like magnesium, zinc, and copper from cashews, plus calcium and phosphorus for bone health. Tomatoes and herbs contribute vitamin C and antioxidants, while the healthy fats provide lasting satiety. It’s a calorie-dense, nutrient-rich dish — great for energy and recovery if eaten in moderation. By using roasted cashews, reducing cream, and pairing it with fiber-rich sides, you can enjoy its flavor and benefits while keeping it balanced.
